## Features
- Power
  - 12V power input via XT30 connector (**3S battery supported**)
  - Dual 12V output via XH2.54 connectors
  - 12V to 5V DC-DC converter (TPS5450DDAR) supporting up to 5A current (**For output currents above 3A, solder mask openings with tin plating should be implemented on copper traces to enhance current handling. [More info and where the step-down converter circuit from](https://oshwhub.com/quan-guo-dian-sai/dian-sai-mo-kuai-tps5450-jiang-ya-mo-kuai)**)
  - Dual 5V output via XH2.54 connectors
- Peripherals
  - 12V bus servo ([Hiwonder HTS-20H](https://www.hiwonder.com/collections/bus-servo/products/hts-20h?variant=39700596916311) is recommended)
  - Dual 12V DC motors via XH2.54 connectors and PH2.0 connectors (motor driver: TB6612FNG)
  - One `SPI` via XH2.54 connector
  - Dual `I2C` via XH2.54 connectors (With another 4 pin header for a 0.96" OLED screen)
  - 14 GPIO pins with `5V` and `GND` (**`GPIO21`,`GPIO38-GPIO40`,`GPIO46-GPIO48` should not be used when the other connectors are in use**) 
  - `UART` pins for `TX`, `RX` and `GND`
